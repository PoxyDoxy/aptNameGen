Forked by PoxyDoxy because memes

Ever wanted to make a Advanced Persistant Threat Group or Some Cyber Crew and cant come up with that perfect name

Well, This product is just for you, with our advanced lists, we can randomly generate you a new crew name without spendig days ripping your hair out

Its not just for the groups either, wanted to attribute to somebody but dont want to call them'just another threat actor", well now you can come up with one on the spot.

I am sorry this is in python, please forgive me

If you want to port this to other languages or such, your welcome to, I dont care,
